In read function string object is created to read text content from file till delimeter. string object function c_str() is used to get char * type from string that can then be used for setname() and setfileid()
changes made in File constructors. calling constructor within another sometimes causes unexpected behaviour therefore using seperate fucntion for deep copy is better choice. One -arg constructor and 3-arg constructors merged by using defualt arguments.
The file that is being read is csv format meaning field are comma seperated and ends with on new line. read() function calls operator >> which read one record at a time and returns back the file pointer back to read()and if it is not End Of File , another record is read. read() requires filename, file type array and no of records.
some functions remains to be coded , as i will get time i will complete it.
